## JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### JavaScript Variables
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
### JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).


**The general rules for constructing names for variables (*unique identifiers*) are:**

* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter
* Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

#### The Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
This is different from algebra.

### JavaScript Data Types

* JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

* In programming, text values are called text strings.

* JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

* Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

* If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
