## Wireframe
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

### Examples of wireframes:
* Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.

* With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.

* Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

### What to consider when deciding on your wireframing process

In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation: 

1. Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
2. Sketch > Code
3. Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
4. Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

If the task is very narrow and the visual design is either set or considered unimportant (such as with many backend administrative interfaces), then sketch > code makes sense, whereas if the time and resources and the business value are all high, then spending the time to make a high-definition wireframe and going through a cycle of testing with a fully realized interactive prototype makes better sense.

### How to make your wireframe in six steps

1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

## HTML basics

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

## Semantics 
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

HTML, CSS and JavaScript, they all have diffrent semantics. read more [semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics).
