## Expressions and operators

![operators](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/JavaScript-Operators-1200x720.jpg)

### 1. Operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators
### 2. Expressions:
 An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
 * ***Primary expressions*** 
 1.this
Use the this keyword to refer to the current object. In general, this refers to the calling object in a method. 

 * ***Grouping operator***

 The grouping operator ( ) controls the precedence of evaluation in expressions. For example, you can override multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction to evaluate addition first.


 * ***Left-hand-side expressions***
 1. new
You can use the new operator to create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types. 
 2. super
The super keyword is used to call functions on an object's parent. It is useful with classes to call the parent constructor.

## Loops and iteration

![loops](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/JavaScript-Loops-1200x900.jpg)

* for statement  
*A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.*

* do...while statement  
*The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.*
* while statement  
*A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.*
* labeled statement  
*A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program.*
* break statement  
*Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.*
* continue statement  
*The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.*
* for...in statement  
*The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property, JavaScript executes the specified statements. *
* for...of statement  
*The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.*
