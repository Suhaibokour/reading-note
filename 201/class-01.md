### How Do People Access the Web?
* Browsers
* Web Servers
* Devices
* Screen readers

### How the Web Works?

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server .

### HTML 

HTML is used to create web pages and we start by writing down the words we want to appear on our page. then we add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on.

#### HTML5
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

#### Why do we use HTML?
HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance.

### CSS 
CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

#### **why do we use CSS?**
* ***Provides Efficiency in Design and Updates***  
 With CSS, we are able to create rules, and apply those rules to many elements within the website. This approach offers many advantages when site-wide changes are required by a client. Since the content is completely separated from the design, we can make those changes in our Style Sheet and have it effect every applicable instance. 
* ***Use Can Lead To Faster Page Downloads***   
Since rules are only downloaded once by the browser, then are cached and used for each page load, the use of CSS can lead to lighter page loads, and improved performance. This contributes to lighter server load and lower requirements, which overall saves money for our clients.
* ***is Easy to Work With***  
Because we are able to keep every visual aspect of the website completely separated from the content, using CSS when designing our websites allows us to quickly create layouts, and troubleshoot any problems. We know that regardless of the page, we control all elements from one (or several) stylesheet.

### WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

### javaScript 
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.
