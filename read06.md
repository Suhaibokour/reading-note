CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.
### What is CSS for?   
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
### CSS syntax  
CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

## How To Add CSS
Three Ways to Insert CSS   

1. External CSS  
*With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.*
2. Internal CSS  
*An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the < style > element, inside the head section.*

3. Inline CSS  
*An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.*

## CSS color Property  
The color property specifies the color of text.  
***Tip: Use a background color combined with a text color that makes the text easy to read.***
