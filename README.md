### My name is **Suhaib Okour** I am 26 years old. I studied **English Language and Linguistics** at Jordan University of Science and Technology. I used to work at a cars dealership company in Sweden but had to comeback to finish my MA studies in applied linguistics. I am currently having a course in software development at LTUC. I am here because I realized that programming is what I have always been passionate about and seizing this opportunity is something a wise man would do.
