I believe that it is a kind of a philosophy that could actually improve your abilities to counter obstacles, expand your vision, boost your self esteem and increase your creativity. 

I also got the idea of an opposite mindset which is the fixed mindset which can be identified as the mindset for those who think that success is something a human is born with and there’s no such thing as developing your own abilities and there’s no point in putting more effort on whatever you’re trying to achieve. On the other hand, a growth mindset is capable of embracing challenges, counter obstacles, put extra effort, learn from criticism and get inspiration from others.

Overall, a growth mindset is a skill that an individual can obtain over time. It takes patience and effort but once you master this way of thinking you will start noticing the difference throughout your career. Whenever you feel down or frustrated remember it will be for a short time but it will result in a long-term improvement of your abilities.
