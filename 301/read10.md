## What is a breakpoint?

* At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

* The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. Using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code. Normally, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select “Console” in the debugger menu.
