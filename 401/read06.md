# Authentication

## Singleton
* singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object. This is helpful usually when a single object is required to coordinate actions across a system.

## Router Middleware
* Router is one of those middleware, what it does actualy is to take the original request, and forward it to a sub handler according to the path example : "/home" for a GET request is mapped to function getHome that handle it and eventually send a response to the client on the behalf of the original handler.

## Dynamic Module Loading
* Dynamic code loading allows an app to pull content from beyond its codebase and execute it during operation, or runtime. This option can result in a smaller app size because a common practice is to store the code remotely instead of embedding it in the Android package kit (APK)

## CRUD -> REST Method Matches 
* CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.CRUD principles are mapped to REST commands to comply with the goals of RESTful architecture.REST stands for representational state transfer

## Mock Testing
* The Full Form of MOCK is Multiple option checking

## Basic Auth
* In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header.

## OWASP auth cheatsheet
* Authentication is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.
