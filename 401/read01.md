### Array.map() method

* The Array.map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function. The callback function will then be executed on each of the arrayâ€™s elements.

### superagent()

* SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

### Array.reduce()

* The reduce() method executes a reducer function for each value of an array.

reduce() returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.

reduce() does not execute the function for empty array elements.

reduce() does not change the original array.

### Promises 

* A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.
