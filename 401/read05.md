# Linked lists.


### what is linked list:

* is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.(that each Node references the next Node in the link.


### Why do we use structure in linked list?

* Structure in linked list is used to store data of the node as well as the pointer to the next node's address. A linked list is a linear collection of similar data where the next node is reached using the previous node in list.

### What is the use of structure in linked list?

* In C programming, we use structures to create a linked list. The structure is a data type inside which we can define variables with different data types (e.g., int , char , pointer , etc.)

### How structure is used in linked list?

* Insert node at the beginning.
* Insert node in the middle.
* Insert node at the end.



### Big O notation

* Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmannâ€“Landau notation or asymptotic notation.

### Input Size:

* Input Size refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm. This does not simply refer to the number of parameters an algorithm reads, but takes into account the size of each parameter value as well.
