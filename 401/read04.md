# Data Modeling


### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
* Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
* TDD creates code that is maintainable, flexible, and easily extensible.
* You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.


### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
* In testing the console.log by implementing it before each test and resetting after each test.

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development.
* The downside to TDD is that it is usually tightly associated with 'Agile' methodology, which places no importance on documentation of a system, rather the understanding behind why a test 'should' return one specific value rather than any other resides only in the developer's head.

### Why REST?
* One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia. 

### Vocabulary Terms:
* functional programming : the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. 
* object-oriented programming (OOP) : A programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods)
* class : Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
* Test Driven Development (TDD) : Before you write implementation code, write some code that proves that the implementation works or fails
* Jest : JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity
* Continuous Integration (CI) : Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.
* REST : Instead of using XML to make a request, REST (usually) relies on a simple URL.
* Data Model : An abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities
