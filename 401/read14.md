# Event Driven Architecture

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
* FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
* the receiver send a notification to the server that the message is received and emit a function to delete the message from the queue.

### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
* The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

### How do you test an event driven system?
* tests for the functions or by emitting events

### terms
* FIFO Queue - First In First Out Queue
* Pub/Sub - async messaging that separates event creation from event processing
