# AWS: Cloud Servers

### AWS
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.


### server
* A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

### Pub/Sub
* which stands for Publisher/Subscriber, allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds. Pub/Sub is used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data. It is equally effective as messaging-oriented middleware for service integration or as a queue to parallelize tasks.

### WRRC 
* A cycle of requests and responses that allow the internet to exist. Clients send requests to servers and servers send responses.

### Amazon EC2
* Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model. We offer the fastest processors in the cloud and we are the only cloud with 400 Gbps ethernet networking. We have the most powerful GPU instances for machine learning training and graphics workloads, as well as the lowest cost-per-inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, HPC, Machine Learning, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud.




### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle.
* the request/response cycle is a useful guide to see how all the app’s files and folders fit together. The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
* Server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers or clients. And client is A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server. Generally, clients are web browsers. The request/response cycle manage the relation ship between the server and the client, the client request some data and the server allow it to access these data and response to it by send the data, the client will respond to the server with assurance message that the message has been delivered successfully.

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
* Application Deployment (also referred to as Software Deployment) is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server. Once the process of deploying the application has been completed it becomes publicly accessible on the URL.
