### How to Solve Programming Problems

* When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes. The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time. 
* The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.

### How to think like a programmer

* Understand : Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them
* Plan : Don’t dive right into solving without a plan. Plan your solution. In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
* Divide : This is the most important step of all.break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.Then, solve each sub-problem one by one.Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem

### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis  

* You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

### 5 Whys Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly 

* Assemble a Team Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you’re trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

* Define the Problem If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, “Team A isn’t meeting its response time targets” or “Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures.”

* Ask the First “Why?” Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, “Why isn’t Team A meeting its response time targets?”)

* Ask “Why?” Four More Times For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further “whys” in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you’ve just recorded.

* Know When to Stop
