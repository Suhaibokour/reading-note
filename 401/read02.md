## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

* The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.
* Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource.

### An introduction to NodeJS and Express
* Express and Node’s main benefits, and roughly what the main parts of an Express app might look like (routes, middleware, error handling, and template code). I should also understand that with Express being an unopinionated framework, the way you pull these parts together and the libraries that you use are largely up to you!

### What is NPM?
* npm is the world’s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.
