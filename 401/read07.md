# Bearer Authorization
### What can you do with an authorization code?
* An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space

### What can you do with an access token?
* Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage

### What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
* It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities

### Client ID
* 	is a unique identifier for a browser–device pair that helps Google Analytics link user actions on a site.

### Client Secret
* a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.

### Authentication Endpoint
* a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.

### Access Token Endpoint
* where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors.

### API Endpoint
* the URL for a server or a service. These APIs operate through responses and requests — that is you make a request and the API Endpoint makes a response.
