# AWS: S3 and Lambda

### Describe “The Cloud”
* The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer. Most cloud services can be accessed through a Web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome, and some companies offer dedicated mobile apps

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
* A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

### What is auto-scaling?
* ets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
* When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

## Terms
* Server Instances:  Instances in AWS are basically virtual environments. These virtual environments are isolated from the underlying base OS. It’s an On-demand service, i.e. a user can rent the virtual server(instances) on an hourly base and deploy their applications on it
* Containers: an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package
* Cloud Services: refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware
* AWS: a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow
* EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: Though EC2/Beanstalk and Heroku seem to do similar jobs they are slightly different. First EC2 is a Infrastructure as a Servce (IaaS) which allows to host an operating system on cloud. However, Elastic Beanstalke and Heroku both are PaaS or platform as a Service. The difference between the two rely on services and price. Heroku tends to have a steeper price range. But it automatically manages, the Dynos and Heroku Postgres resources. It has an easier learning curve as most of the work is done through it’s services. On the other hand, AWS’ Beanstalk is slightly more complicated but has a more linear price range. Also, being part of the AWS infrastructure is easily integrated with other AWS services.
